# Quake4SDK

SDK to develop mods for Quake 4 on Linux.

# Dependencies

For the SDK you must have:

- You must have CMake 3.13 or greater.
- GCC compiler.
- A VALID COPY OF QUAKE 4 SOMEWHERE!!!

# Setup

## Quake 4 on Linux

Quake 4 did not ship with any Linux binaries, but id software USED TO provide a binary to patch it. I have created a script to automate most of the setup.

```
./install.sh [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-s QUAKE_DIR]

-o		Specifies where the new Linux version will live. Defaults to "~/Games/Quake 4"
-s		Specifies where the old Quake 4 lives. Defaults to "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Quake 4"
```

Make sure curl is installed, or the script will complain and bail.

### Arch / Arch based

For Arch, make sure you have `[multilib]` section enabled in `/etc/pacman.conf`. Then, run:
`$ sudo pacman -Sy`
and then make sure the following packages are installed:
- lib32-glibc
- lib32-libxext
- lib32-libx11
- lib32-zlib
- lib32-mesa
- lib32-sdl2

### Ubuntu

To enable multilib on Ubuntu, run:
`$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386`
and then refresh the repositories:
`$ sudo apt update`

Then, make sure the following packages are installed:
- gcc-multilib
- libx11-6:i386
- zlib1g:i386
- libxext6:i386
- libgl1:i386
- libsdl2-2.0-0

## Developing with the SDK

Simply use your favorite IDE to modify the source code. When you want to build it, simply run `build.sh`. This will provide a `gamex86.so` file in the `build` directory. Simply copy this into your Quake 4 game folder.
